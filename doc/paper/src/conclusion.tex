Evolution of today's computer science demands increasingly new and intelligent
approaches. Steganography is a field with a very long history. Starting from
the antique wax tablets, continuing with invisible ink, steganography has also
evolved, so that nowadays we can speak of digital steganography.

Our project successfully adds up to this research direction. We have managed to
implement a novel approach, we have a working steganographic communication and,
as far as we know, the biggest amount of hidden data transmitted inside a
single segment. We have used the TCP header, more precisely the "Options"
field, sending a total of 37 bytes per TCP segment.

Future work will include some things that Radu considers important.
You can also add (deasupra paragrafului asta) alte informatii care se cred a fi
de cuviinta. Covertops FTW.
