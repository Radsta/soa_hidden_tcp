Steganography is the science of writing hidden messages in such a way that no
one, apart from the sender and intended recipient, suspects the existence of
the message, a form of security through obscurity. Access control to a server
is still one of the main focus points of network and computer security and
new solutions on how to improve it are always welcomed. This paper presents
a communication protocol which handles user authentication and remote
command execution by encoding the information in the TCP/IP header, using a
client-server model. The encoded data is placed in the options section of the
TCP/IP header. We discuss steganography, present the components comprising our
solution and show the results of our efforts.
